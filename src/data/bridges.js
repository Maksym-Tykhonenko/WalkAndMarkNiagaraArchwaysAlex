    name: 'Rainbow Bridge',

    latitude: 43.0896,
    longitude: 79.0717,
    description: `The Rainbow Bridge, officially known as the Niagara Falls International Rainbow Bridge, stands as one of the most iconic pedestrian and vehicle crossings between Canada and the United States. Completed in 1941, it spans the Niagara River just downstream from the world-famous Horseshoe Falls, connecting Niagara Falls, Ontario, with Niagara Falls, New York. The bridge replaced the previous Honeymoon Bridge, which collapsed in 1938 due to ice pressure.
Its graceful steel arch, painted in soft neutral tones, perfectly frames the natural backdrop of mist and falling water. For many travelers, walking across the Rainbow Bridge offers a unique perspective of the falls — a panoramic view unobtainable from either side alone. The name "Rainbow" was inspired by the frequent appearance of rainbows in the misty air above the gorge.
Today, the bridge serves both as a functional border crossing and a cultural symbol of binational unity, often bustling with tourists, photographers, and couples rekindling the romance of early 20th-century honeymooners.`,

    name: 'Whirlpool Rapids Bridge',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/2.png'),
    latitude: 43.1042,
    longitude: 43.1042,
    description: `Built in 1897, the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge is a double-decked steel arch bridge located north of the Rainbow Bridge, crossing over the turbulent Whirlpool Rapids of the Niagara River. The upper deck carries the Amtrak and VIA Rail trains, while the lower deck is reserved for passenger vehicles — though access is limited to those with special border cards (NEXUS).
The bridge’s historic latticework of steel girders reflects the golden age of railway engineering. Its understated, industrial character contrasts with the natural power of the river below, creating a striking juxtaposition. Unlike the more commercial Rainbow Bridge, the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge has retained a quiet dignity, serving as a steadfast sentinel of international travel.
Surrounded by cliffs and deep swirling waters, this lesser-known crossing is beloved by train enthusiasts and those seeking a more hidden, authentic connection to the region's engineering past.`,

    name: 'Lewiston–Queenston Bridge',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/3.png'),
    latitude: 43.1555,
    longitude: 79.0502,
    description: `The Lewiston–Queenston Bridge links the towns of Lewiston, New York, and Queenston, Ontario. Completed in 1962, it is the northernmost of the Niagara River crossings and a vital transportation route for commercial trucks and long-distance travelers.
Stretching 1,594 feet (486 m) across the river, the bridge stands on a high elevation and offers sweeping views of the Niagara Gorge and the river’s course toward Lake Ontario. The crossing also commemorates a site of great historical significance: just west of the bridge lies the battlefield of Queenston Heights, where one of the War of 1812’s key engagements took place.
Unlike the Rainbow Bridge, this span is less frequented by foot travelers, but its functional importance and proximity to heritage landmarks make it an essential part of the region’s story.`,

    name: 'Peace Bridge',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/4.png'),
    latitude: 42.9044,
    longitude: 78.9086,
    description: `Though not directly next to the falls, the Peace Bridge spans the mouth of the Niagara River between Fort Erie, Ontario, and Buffalo, New York. Opened in 1927, it was named to commemorate 100 years of peace between Canada and the United States following the War of 1812.
Constructed of steel trusses and designed to carry heavy commercial loads, the bridge is a testament to interwar optimism and economic collaboration. Stretching nearly a mile in length, it carries thousands of commuters and goods daily, linking two major cities with shared industrial and cultural heritage.
Lit by modern LED systems at night, the Peace Bridge is as symbolic as it is practical — a literal bridge of peace standing at the threshold of the Great Lakes.`,

    name: 'International Railway Bridge',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/5.png'),
    latitude: 43.1058,
    longitude: 79.0611,
    description: `Often overshadowed by its larger and more visible siblings, the International Railway Bridge just upstream of the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge is dedicated solely to rail traffic. This historic structure has quietly played a central role in trade and tourism since the early 20th century, carrying passenger and freight trains alike across the border.
Its utilitarian design and lower profile make it easy to overlook — yet its endurance, carrying the weight of time and transit, gives it a kind of nobility. As trains hum across the span, it remains a living artery in the circulatory system of North American travel, its presence felt more than seen.`,

    name: 'Upper Steel Arch Bridge (Historical — collapsed 1938)',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/6.png'),
    latitude: 43.0902,
    longitude: 79.0715,
    description: `Also known as the Honeymoon Bridge, this elegant steel arch was completed in 1898 and once spanned the Niagara River just below the falls. For four decades, it was the primary crossing for horse-drawn carriages, automobiles, and pedestrians.
The bridge was known for its impressive 840-foot single span — one of the longest in the world at its time — and its romantic association with honeymooners visiting Niagara Falls. However, in January 1938, severe ice buildup in the gorge caused the structure’s foundations to fail, leading to a dramatic collapse captured on film and in photographs.
Today, the site is marked by memory rather than structure. Standing near the current Rainbow Bridge, visitors can still sense the presence of the vanished span — a ghost of engineering past that inspired its graceful successor.`,

    name: 'Michigan Central Railway Bridge (Abandoned)',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/7.png'),
    latitude: 43.1047,
    longitude: 79.0649,
    description: `This haunting relic of a once-thriving railway route looms just beside the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge. Built in 1925 to replace the earlier Cantilever Bridge, the Michigan Central Railway Bridge carried rail traffic until 2001.
Constructed of imposing concrete and steel, it was designed to be a robust solution for growing freight demand. Although disused, the bridge still stands — a brooding monument above the river, covered in rust, shadow, and time. While access is prohibited, it remains visible from lookout points and continues to fascinate urban explorers and railway historians.
It is one of the few non-demolished, unused international railway bridges left in North America.`,

    name: 'International Control Dam Bridge',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/8.png'),
    latitude: 43.0909,
    longitude: 79.0584,
    description: `This bridge isn’t for tourists — but it’s crucial for Niagara itself. Spanning part of the river upstream from the falls, the International Control Dam Bridge is part of the hydroelectric water diversion infrastructure jointly managed by Canada and the United States.
While not open to public traffic, the bridge forms a strategic link between both nations’ water authorities. It’s used to adjust flow toward the hydro tunnels and to manage river levels. A stark industrial design — low, concrete, and unadorned — it contrasts sharply with the elegance of the Rainbow or Whirlpool Bridges, but without it, the falls and power systems would be far less stable.`,

    name: 'Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) Bridge over Welland River',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/9.png'),
    latitude: 43.2392,
    longitude: 79.0698,
    description: `Located just outside Niagara Falls in the city of Niagara-on-the-Lake, this highway bridge carries the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) over the Welland River — a tributary of the Niagara River. Though technically not a cross-border bridge, it serves thousands of vehicles heading to or from the Lewiston–Queenston Bridge.
It is a modern concrete girder bridge, built for efficiency and scale rather than aesthetics. Still, its role in channeling traffic through the Niagara Peninsula means it’s part of the region’s vital transportation web.`,

    name: 'Niagara Parkway Pedestrian Overpasses',
    image: require('../assets/images/bridges/10.png'),
    latitude: 43.0767,
    longitude: 79.0772,
    description: `Scattered along the scenic Niagara Parkway are several small pedestrian overpasses and underpasses that allow visitors to safely cross the busy road. These bridges, though modest, serve a crucial role in the tourism ecosystem of the area.
Often made of stone or concrete with metal railings, they blend gently into the surrounding landscape of gardens, parks, and river views. Some are found near the Floral Clock, others closer to the Niagara Glen Nature Reserve or the Butterfly Conservatory.
They remind us that not all bridges are grand or famous — some exist simply to make exploration safer, smoother, and more connected.`,
